Runs full screen (no browser bar)

Has a splash screen & loading states

Has smooth navigation & transitions

Uses our existing backend & features

Feels like an actual mobile app, not just a website in a browser

Please use the current app as the source of truth for all features and flows, and add/adjust what’s needed to make it a proper PWA.

1. PWA Setup (Technical Requirements)

Please implement all core PWA pieces:

Web App Manifest (manifest.json)

Name & short_name for the app

Description

Icons in all required sizes (for Android & iOS)

"display": "standalone" (or "fullscreen" if appropriate)

"start_url" set correctly (e.g. our main dashboard or landing page)

"background_color" and "theme_color" matching our brand

Service Worker

Register a service worker for:

Basic offline support (cache shell + assets where it makes sense)

Caching strategy for static assets (logo, CSS, JS, fonts)

Make sure it doesn’t break dynamic features (forms, API calls, auth).

HTTPS

Ensure everything is served over HTTPS (required for PWA install).

Lighthouse

Optimize so we pass the PWA checklist in Lighthouse (installable, manifest, service worker, etc.).

2. Mobile-App-Like UX & Navigation

I want the UX to feel like a real app, not just a shrunk website:

Make sure all main screens are mobile responsive and optimized for small screens.

Use app-like navigation patterns:

Bottom tab bar or clear menu for key sections (Dashboard, Profile, Settings, etc.).

Smooth page transitions (no janky reloads).

Handle back navigation properly:

Pressing back on mobile should behave like a normal app (no weird jumps).

If you need to refactor any pages or components to feel more “app-like,” please do it and let me know what you changed.

3. Loading States & Splash Experience

I want proper loading and not blank screens:

Splash Screen / Launch

Use the manifest + meta tags so that when the app launches from the home screen, it shows a splash screen with:

Our logo

Our brand colors

In-App Loading States

For all key data-fetching screens (dashboard, lists, etc.):

Add skeleton loaders or spinners instead of empty or flashing content.

Make sure loading states are consistent across the app.

4. Auth, Offline & Session Handling

Keep using the same login / signup / auth logic, but make it smooth on mobile:

Keep the user logged in where possible (respecting security best practices).

Define a clear behavior for offline:

If offline, show a friendly message like “You’re offline – some features may not work” rather than breaking.

If possible, cache basic UI shell so the app still opens.

5. Install Experience

Make sure the app:

Shows as “Installable” in Chrome DevTools.

Triggers the “Add to Home Screen” prompt where possible (Android).

For iOS (Safari), please:

Make sure the app works when added to home screen (no broken links).

Set any necessary iOS meta tags for full-screen mode and status bar styling.

6. Optional (If Feasible Now or Later)

If it’s not too complex, plan/prepare for:

Push Notifications (for later):

Structure the app so we can add push notifications down the line (for reminders, updates, etc.).

Deep links / URL handling:

If a user opens a specific URL from a notification, it should open the correct screen inside the PWA.

7. Delivery

When you’re done, please send me:

A short summary of:

What was added for the PWA (manifest, service worker, routing changes, etc.)

Any limitations (especially on iOS)
